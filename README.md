Live demo Link
Navigate into the Project Folder
cd Task-A
Open the index.html file in a browser of your choice to view the project.
No additional setup is required since this project only involves front-end code (HTML, CSS, JS).

Technology Choices and Rationale
HTML: Used for the structure and layout of the web page.
CSS: Used for styling, including the background gradients, box designs, and animations.
JavaScript: Used for adding functionality to drag and scroll the elements, along with basic DOM manipulation.

Known Limitations / Trade-offs
No server-side functionality: This is a front-end only project, so there's no back-end interaction or database.
Limited drag-and-scroll range: The scrolling behavior might not be as smooth or optimized for large content areas.
Browser Compatibility: The drag-and-scroll feature might not work well in all browsers, especially older ones.

Future Improvements
Improve smooth scrolling performance, especially for large elements.
Implement responsiveness for different screen sizes.
